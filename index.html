                        I have practiced photography for about 4 years by now and managed to get a good amount of experience doing it.<br>
                        During those 4 years I got the chance to photograph a variety of subjects, some of which I want to show off to you on the subpage linked below.

                        In the past year I have started working on my own Home Network. <br>
                        It started with a network switch that, I used to connect my various devices to the Internet. <br>
                        Now it expanded to a Desktop computer that I built myself,
                        as well as a repurposed gaming computer (running on windows 10) <br>  
                        that has been turned into a home server that serves as a Media Server utilizing Jellyfin <br>
                        and a NAS using Window's built in file sharing ultilities.
